The knock-knock game has much hidden knowledge in it!  What can you learn from the patterns in script.js?
### 10 Scavenger Hunt Questions:###
These get harder as you go.  
1. What are the blue parts (light) | yellow parts (dark) called?
**keyword**
2. What is true about ALMOST ALL of these (ends)?
**they all start with "else"**
3. What are the black parts (light) | blue-gray parts (dark) called?
**attributes**
4. what is true of almost all of these the first time you see them? 
**they all start with "function"**
5. What do you call a complete line of code in Javascript? 
**a statement**
6. What is true about SOME of these: brown parts (light) | salmon parts (dark)?
**they are a built-in function that displays a dialog box with a message and allows the user to input data**
7. What do the parentheses "mean"?  What do they "do"?
**they hold argument for functions**
8. What do the green parts "mean"?  What do they "do"?
**The green parts are the headlines of the knock knock jokes.**
9. What is the difference between = and == ?
**= is used for assigning values to a variable in JavaScript. == is used to compare two variables irrespective of the variable's data type.**
10. What happens if you click the minus sign (or down arrows) by "function"?
**The rest of the code will vanish, and only leave the function line.**
11. What other patterns do you see? 
**I see that for every code other than the simple version, there is always an "else".
